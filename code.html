            A Windows utility for converting MIDI input events into simulated
            keystrokes, mouse events, and scripted macros with Lua integration.
            It was coded in C++ with Qt over the span of a three-week blitz in
            2021 after I got fed up with the existing MIDI macro tools on the
            market.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm satisfied with what I was able to accomplish with MidiMutt, and
            I still use it all the time for productivity and fun. If I were to
            ever update it further, however, I would streamline the process of
            filling up a preset with mappings. The Lua scripting could use some
            hardening against exceptions as well.

            This was my first Unity project for INFO3120 at Fanshawe, which was
            intended to be a clone of Flappy Bird (and helped a lot with getting
            into the workflow of Unity). I had a lot of fun working on the
            character art for this one and adding little gameplay touches to
            give it a little more charm, like the yipping and yapping and sprite
            rotation whenever the coyote "jumps". I also added a little coffee
            item that floats by periodically and gives you a score bonus if you
            can manage to grab it.

          <p>
            My second Unity project for INFO3120 at Fanshawe. The assignment
            topic was "survival game", so naturally this game involves fending
            off hordes of bats as a gunslinging pigeon deep in the sewers. While
            I'm happy with certain things like the sprite animation and
            punchiness of gameplay, the art style is more uncoordinated than I'd
            like - I wish I had time to work on original art for the bats and
            pigeon character. Getting closer to feeling like a "real" game
            though!
