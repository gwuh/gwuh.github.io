          <p>Hi! My name is Jason Ferguson.</p>
          <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Photo of me at Niagara Falls contemplating why there's so much water" width="180px" />
          <p>
            I'm big into drawing, programming, and playing piano, in that order.
            I've been doing two of those off-and-on since I was a wee pup, but I
            only got to programming in my late teens, starting with Lua about 7
            or 8 years ago and moving on to suffering with C++ a few years
            later. And now I'm in college to eventually land a career full of it!</p>
            <p>I'm trying to cultivate a personality outside of those things
            though, so I'm also obligated to mention that I like birds and dogs
            quite a lot. Probably fanatic even. But maybe you already picked up on that
            from my art. They're just good animals, okay? Leave me alone.</p>
